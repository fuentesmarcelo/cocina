A repository filled with updates to my full stack web application, Cocina. Daily pushes to this repo.

How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS


Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

Lessons Learned:
The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve. Small improvements every week.
